# Appendix: Can LLMs Effectively Simulate Human Learners? Teachersâ€™ Insights from Tutoring LLM Students

The PDF file `Appendix_Can_LLMs_Simulate_Learners.pdf` contains figures and tables explaining the interview design and preceding analysis:
1. Participant Information: Demographics and teaching experience of interview participants
2. Statistical Tests on MathDial: Results of statistical tests comparing typical vs. non-typical interactions with LLM students
3. Interview Questions: A table with interview questions, along with their connection to preceding dialogue analysis and theoretical frameworks

The `Supplementary_video.mp4` file presents an imaginary example to motivate the research on LLM student simulations.
